;Palette Name: Nostalgi8RE
;Description: Revisited, Rebuilt, Reimagined. Nostalgi8RE is a built-from-the-ground-up remake of Nostalgi8, that aims at fixing some issues with the original version while adding it's own things to the mix (That I've learned in these two years making palettes). With more vibrant, desaturated colors, it's the perfect way to give a nostalgic feeling to your art.<br>
